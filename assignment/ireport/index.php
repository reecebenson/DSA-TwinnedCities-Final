				<h4>Attempting to setup phpDocumentor</h4>
				<p>After numerous attempts of attempting to set up phpDocumentor, I gave up. The installation process was too chunky and irritating in order to get it working
				on my computer. I got it working only one time, and when it generated all the files, the documentation seemed incomplete - so, onto the next documentation
				generator.</p>

				<h4>Attempting to setup ApiGen</h4>
				<p>ApiGen seemed light weight and easy to execute, a simple composer set up and then run it from command line... but it seems the NetBeans IDE for PHP is outdated
				as ApiGen no longer takes the <em>--source</em> attribute. I got it running by running the commands through command prompt, but then ApiGen had issues within itself
				with an error complaining about T_UNSET in the parser.</p>

				<h4>What now?</h4>
				<p>Since my failed attempts, what's easier than trying to set up someone elses code and libraries? Write your own documentation from hand, as I've already got it in
				the files to start with, so this is the option I'm going with.</p>

				<h4>The Documentation</h4>
				<p>You can start reading the documentation by <a href="documentation.php">clicking here</a>, it should be fairly self explanatory.</p>
