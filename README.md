# DSA - Twinned Cities

This is an implementation of the Twinned Cities for Data, Schemas and Applications at the University of the West of England.

# Overview
#### Learning Objectives:
* Using Web based services and API's to process data;
* Designing, processing and generating XML files;
* Linking software components with function calls and HTTP GET & POST;
* Understanding and using HTML5, RSS and other XML vocabularies (XSLT, XSD);
* Understanding and using JSON and JavaScript;
* Creating two XML meta-data files and validating them against supplied Schemas;
* Integrating information from other scripts into a single HTML page;
* Planning, designing and implementing a Software Project;
* Experiencing team based software construction.

#### Summary:
*  Twin towns or sister cities are a form of legal and social agreement between towns and cities ... in geographically and politically distinct areas to promote cultural and commercial ties. The modern concept of town twinning, conceived after the Second World War in 1947, was intended to foster friendship and understanding between different cultures and between former foes as an act of peace and reconciliation and to encourage trade and tourism. In recent times, town twinning has increasingly been used to form strategic international business links between member cities.
* Many (most) towns & cities in the UK are twinned with others in Europe & around the world. Wikipedia provides a list of these twinned towns/cities.

#### The Application:
* Working in groups of three to four students, your task in this assignment is to build a data driven web application that makes use of external API's and local data storage to encourage interest in twinning.
* Your application will show information about your chosen town or city and at least one of its twins.
